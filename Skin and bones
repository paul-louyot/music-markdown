l1: And we spoke in past tense

l1: Reminisce 'bout back when our spirits used to dance with each other

l1: We been smoking gas, yeah

l1: This is so romantic, I never wanna press fast forward

l1: You treat me like I'm more than a pair of skin and bones

l1: And that really made a difference in my story

l1: Life will take its toll

l1: But whichever way we go

l1: Know I'm right here by your side, shawty

l1: Skin and bones under the covers

l1: Kept our love undercover

l1: Nonchalant, very subtle

l1: Tryin' not to step on the puddle

l1: Write on your flesh

l1: With permanent ink

l1: Light the incense

l1: Remember this scent

l1: High as a bitch

l1: But you won't catch me slip

l1: I know nothing

l1: I know I don't

l1: And we spoke in past tense

l1: Reminisce 'bout back when our spirits used to dance with each other

l1: Know I'm right here by your side, shawty

l1: Yeah, what a contrast

l1: My skin and bones against the color of your aura

l1: On a Sunday

l1: Walkin' slow while time was still runnin'

l1: The moon's favorite daughter

l1: Light in the dark, and the waves in the water

l1: Ooh, oh, yeah

l1: If I can't be brave

l1: And let you walk away

l1: Maybe next life you'll be mine again

l1: (Maybe next life you'll be mine again)
