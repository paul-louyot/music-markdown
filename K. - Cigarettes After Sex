l1:    I remember when I first noticed that you liked me back

l1: We were sitting down in a restaurant, waiting for the check

l1: We had made love earlier that day with no strings attached

l1: But I could tell that something had changed, how you looked at me then

#

l2: Kristen, come right back

l2: I've been waiting for you

l2: To slip back in bed

l2: When you light the candle

#

l1: And on the Lower East Side, you're dancing with me now

l1: And I'm taking pictures of you with flowers on the wall

l1: Think I like you best when you're dressed in black from head to toe

l1: Think I like you best when you're just with me and no one else

#

l2: chorus

#

l1: And I'm kissing you, lying in my room

l1: Holding you until you fall asleep

l1: And it's just as good as I knew it would be

l1: Stay with me, I don't want you to leave
