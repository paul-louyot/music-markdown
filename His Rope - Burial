l1: Here's the tiny piece of you I saved

l1: I awake to the birds singing

l1: I cut the rope

l1: Step out

l1: In an instant it's all over

l1: I'm done

#

l1: Here's the tiny piece of you I save

l1: Just enough rope

l1: Just enough rope

l1: Sex and death

l1: Total self-destruction

l1: Turn your body over

l1: To me

#

l1: Still awake in the morning mist

l1: Grant me some grace

l1: Grant me some grace

l1: You don't have to worry

l1: Forgiven and forgotten

l1: Move on

#

l1: Herе's the tiny piece of you I savе

l1: Maybe tomorrow

l1: In another city

l1: Where they don't know our names

l1: Drips of honey

l1: Eyes dilate

l1: And losing our way

l1: Between
