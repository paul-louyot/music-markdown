c1: C Dm Am Dm

[Chorus]

c1:
l1: I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me

l1: The start of nothin'

l1: I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'

l1: The start of nothin'

l1: Ooh, I could hate you now

l1: It's quite alright to hate me now

l1: When we both know that deep down

l1: The feeling still deep down is good


[Verse 1]

l1: If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking

l1: If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces

l1: Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then

l1: We didn't give a fuck back then

l1: I ain't a kid no more

l1: We'll never be those kids again

l1: We'd drive to Syd's

l1: Had the X6 back then, back then

l1: No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then

l1: Everything sucked back then, we were friends


[Chorus]

l1: I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me

l1: The start of nothin'

l1: I had no chance to prepare, I couldn't see you comin'

l1: The start of nothin'

l1: Ooh, I could hate you now

l1: It's quite alright to hate me now

l1: But we both know that deep down

l1: The feeling still deep down is good


[Verse 2]

l1: In the halls of your hotel

l1: Arm around my shoulder so I could tell

l1: How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then

l1: We had time to kill back then

l1: You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again

l1: It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?


[Bridge]

l1: I broke your heart last week

l1: You'll probably feel better by the weekend

l1: Still remember, had you going crazy

l1: Screamin' my name, the feeling deep down is good


[Chorus]

l1: I thought that I was dreamin' when you said you love me

l1: The start of nothin'

l1: Had no chance to prepare, couldn't see you comin'

l1: And we started from nothin'

l1: Ooh, I could hate you now

l1: It's alright to hate me now

l1: We both know that deep down

l1: The feeling still deep down is good


[Outro]

l1: All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do

l1: There were things you didn't need to say, did you mean to? Mean to?

l1: I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you

l1: I've been dreamin' of you, dreamin' of you

l1: I've been dreamin', dreamin'
